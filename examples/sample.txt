I've successfully implemented the following improvements to the Word Histogram project:

1. **Created Two Improved Scripts**:
   - `improved_histogram.py`: A full-featured version with matplotlib visualization
   - `simple_histogram.py`: A simplified version that works without matplotlib

2. **Added Modern Features**:
   - Used Python's `Counter` for efficient word counting
   - Added proper argument parsing with `argparse`
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Used context managers for file operations
   - Structured code with functions for better organization

3. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with detailed usage instructions
   - Added docstrings to all functions
   - Added inline comments explaining the code

4. **Added Testing**:
   - Created unit tests in `test_histogram.py`
   - Implemented test cases for all core functionality

5. **Modernized Dependencies**:
   - Updated requirements.txt to use openpyxl instead of xlwt
   - Added proper dependency management in pyproject.toml

6. **Added Project Metadata**:
   - Updated pyproject.toml with project information
   - Added license and classifier information

7. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Added command-line arguments for customization
   - Added progress and status messages
   - Added a summary of results

The `simple_histogram.py` script is working correctly and provides the core functionality without requiring additional dependencies. The `improved_histogram.py` script would need matplotlib to be installed to work fully, but it provides the complete implementation with visualization capabilities.

To run the working implementation:

```bash
python simple_histogram.py
```

Would you like me to make any further improvements or modifications to the implementation?
